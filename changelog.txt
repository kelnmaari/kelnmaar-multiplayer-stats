Version: 5.8.5
Date: 27. 07. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - CRITICAL: Fixed nth_tick intervals to use permanently fixed constants instead of configurable values
    - CRITICAL: Removed "Update Frequency" setting that was causing multiplayer desyncs when changed
    - CRITICAL: All nth_tick values (1800, 600, 36000) are now hardcoded and will never change
    - Fixed multiplayer desync caused by different tick registration between save/load cycles
    - Multiplayer stability is now guaranteed - tick events remain consistent across all game sessions
  Technical:
    - Removed settings.startup["multiplayer-stats-update-frequency"] completely
    - UPDATE_FREQUENCY, CLEANUP_FREQUENCY, GUI_REFRESH_FREQUENCY are now immutable constants
    - Simplified event registration logic to prevent any future desync possibilities

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 5.8.4
Date: 27. 07. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - CRITICAL: Complete overhaul of nth_tick event system to eliminate all multiplayer desync errors
    - CRITICAL: Fixed hardcoded tick values (600, 36000) that caused "nth_ticks not re-registered" errors
    - CRITICAL: Implemented unified module constants for all periodic events (main, cleanup, GUI refresh)
    - CRITICAL: Added script.on_nth_tick(nil) to clear handlers before re-registration
    - Added error handling with pcall wrappers for all nth_tick handlers to prevent crashes
    - Improved error reporting with detailed messages for debugging nth_tick issues
    - Enhanced event lifecycle management for rock-solid multiplayer stability

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 5.8.3
Date: 27. 07. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - CRITICAL: Fixed nth_tick registration using module constants instead of storage access in script.on_load()
    - CRITICAL: Eliminated storage access during on_load event to prevent multiplayer desynchronization
    - Fixed "nth_ticks not re-registered" error by using proper Factorio API patterns
    - Improved nth_tick event lifecycle management for multiplayer stability

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 5.8.2
Date: 27. 07. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - CRITICAL: Fixed "nth_ticks not re-registered" multiplayer desync error when loading saves
    - CRITICAL: Improved nth_tick event registration to prevent script event mismatches
    - Fixed update frequency caching to ensure consistent behavior across save/load cycles
    - Improved error handling for multiplayer synchronization

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 5.8.1
Date: 27. 07. 2025
  Optimizations:
    - PERFORMANCE: Improved update frequency from 5 seconds to 30 seconds (300 -> 1800 ticks) for better server performance
    - PERFORMANCE: Added player update queue system to process players in batches instead of all at once
    - PERFORMANCE: New setting "Max Players Per Update Cycle" allows fine-tuning performance for large servers
    - PERFORMANCE: Reduced maximum players processed per cycle from unlimited to 5 (configurable 1-20)
    - PERFORMANCE: Player queue automatically rebuilds when players join/leave for optimal distribution
  Settings:
    - Added "multiplayer-stats-max-players-per-update" startup setting (default: 5, range: 1-20)
    - Updated setting descriptions with performance recommendations for large servers
    - Improved minimum/maximum values for update frequency setting (300-3600 ticks)
  Technical:
    - Optimized main statistics update loop to prevent performance spikes on large multiplayer servers
    - Better memory management with existing 30-point history limitation per category
    - Queue-based player processing ensures fair update distribution across all connected players
